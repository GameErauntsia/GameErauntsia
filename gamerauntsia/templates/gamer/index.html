        <p>This is a great place to start off with a short and sweet description of your company, organization, or whatever purpose your website is serving. Keep it friendly, engaging, but short enough to where you won't lose your reader!</p>
        <p>If you need a bit more space to describe what is going on, we recommend putting a picture in this section. Use the
            <code>pull-right</code>class on the image to make it look good!</p>
